    "# A Soft Introduction to Machine Learning with Naïve Bayes\n",

    "For these next two modules, we will be dipping our feet into the metaphorical ocean that is machine learning. This module is meant to familiarize you with the packages and tools to get you started making some prediction given a set of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will be working with two particular algorithms that will classify some target given a set of inputs: Naïve Bayes and Decision Trees. We are going to provide the methods to allow us to hit the ground running with these algorithms and the complimentary data preparation in order to make more accurate models. Keep in mind that there are some more abstract mathematical concepts under the hood of these functions, but for the purpose of these two modules, we are going to de-emphasize the math involved and focus on how to use the tools. This is not to say that the math is unimportant, quite the opposite in fact, and the concepts will be discussed in further detail in the Statistical and Mathematical Foundations course as well as through out the curriculum. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this module and the next, we will only be discussing four such algorithms and when they are appropriate to use. Naïve Bayes and Decision Trees, the two we will be using today, are not as complex as many of the others, but they are still widely used in the machine learning community. Why? Because they work surprisingly well when making decisions.\n",

What are the concepts of training and testing data, and what is the difference between the two? How do we know that all of the features are contributing to the model? Can we refine our model by selecting only certain variables? During the practices, we will tackle these questions."
