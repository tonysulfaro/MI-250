Well, we will be touching on the concepts and code that we ran through in the subsequent labs and practices, except the majority of the coding will be done by you now. The questions that we ask of you will be very familiar, although the output might throw a few more errors. Some of these issues we have not seen yet and this is meant to challenge you. "
