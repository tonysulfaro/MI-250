Restful APIs

Compare 3 different ones:

developer.github.com/v3/
developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index
instagram.com/developer/ (old API)

which is the most RESTful? and which is the least?
why and why not provide examples


GitHub RESTful characteristics:

+ has similar URL/URI? patterns to restful (at least from what I know anyway)

+ uses URL patterns for navigating item structure then parameters to filter it

+ less private information (stars, repositories etc so can do a get on their ID specifically)




Twitter RESTful characteristics:

+ invokes operations with /item/method
    GET friendships/show

- not restful in that doing a GET on friends/lists is going to be different depending on who is logged in

+ authenticates using similar URL pattern, only pass token in as a parameter whereas Instagram sends in client id etc.
    https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate?oauth_token=Z6eEdO8MOmk394WozF5oKyuAv855l4Mlqo7hhlSLik



Instagram RESTful characteristics:

+ has similar uri paths to twitter (RESTful) for fetching data e.g.
    https://api.instagram.com/v1/media/657988443280050001_25025320/likes

- Not restful it seems for authentication in that it is passing parameters directly in the URL to authenticate
    https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=CLIENT-ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT-URI&response_type=code
